Overview

Reveal is a digital global good that geo-enables planning and delivery of health interventions to the last mile. Use of this platform to deliver life-saving health campaigns has shown significant, cost-effective impact in terms of lives saved. The platform has undergone significant progress along its roadmap -- in May 2022, a new version was launched (Reveal 3.0) with greatly improved stability, syncing speed and user experience. 
The vision for Reveal is to allow users within Ministries of Health to configure, deploy, monitor and maintain Reveal. 

What is Reveal?

Reveal is an open-source digital global good that enables country governments and implementing partners to use geospatial data and technology to efficiently and effectively deliver life-saving intervention campaigns. Reveal applies satellite imagery products to map all houses and communities, providing a basemap by which field teams navigate by. Through Reveal, teams are able to visualize a more complete picture of where populations reside, which is especially important in the rural and highly urban settings in which the platform is used. These settings typically do not have address systems or complete census data. 
Reveal consists of a web-based platform for microplanning and monitoring of health intervention delivery (Figure 1A) and an Android mobile client (Figure 1B) which field teams use to navigate house to house or community to community, and capture data to monitor delivery of health interventions in a geo-enabled fashion. Data have shown that use of Reveal has significantly contributed to improved coverage of health interventions like mass drug administration or childhood vaccinations, as well as cost savings per live saved.
            
The Reveal mobile client (‘Android client’) is used by field teams to navigate house to house (or community to community). Field teams are able to visualize houses which have been targeted for health intervention delivery. Users can select a house when they are within a specific radius, and capture data against the house, and individuals residing there. Through this project, we propose to make all fields configurable by superusers to allow quick deployment without the need for hardcoding and outside software development expertise. 
As data are captured, they sync to dashboards for viewing on maps and in table format. Syncing occurs when network connectivity is available.
